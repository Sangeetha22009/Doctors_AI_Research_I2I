{"title": "Infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections and reinfections during the Omicron wave.", "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals and reinfections in previously infected individuals have become increasingly common. Such infections highlight a broader need to understand the contribution of vaccination, including booster doses, and natural immunity to the infectiousness of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially in high-risk populations with intense transmission, such as in prisons. Here we show that both vaccine-derived and naturally acquired immunity independently reduce the infectiousness of persons with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 infections in a prison setting. Analyzing SARS-CoV-2 surveillance data from December 2021 to May 2022 across 35 California state prisons with a predominately male population, we estimate that unvaccinated Omicron cases had a 36% (95% confidence interval (CI): 31-42%) risk of transmitting infection to close contacts, as compared to a 28% (25-31%) risk among vaccinated cases. In adjusted analyses, we estimated that any vaccination, prior infection alone and both vaccination and prior infection reduced an index case's risk of transmitting infection by 22% (6-36%), 23% (3-39%) and 40% (20-55%), respectively. Receipt of booster doses and more recent vaccination further reduced infectiousness among vaccinated cases. These findings suggest that, although vaccinated and/or previously infected individuals remain highly infectious upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in this prison setting, their infectiousness is reduced compared to individuals without any history of vaccination or infection.

{"title": "Age-specific contribution of contacts to transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany.", "abstract": "Current estimates of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 spread in Germany using infectious disease models often do not use age-specific infection parameters and are not always based on age-specific contact matrices of the population. They also do usually not include setting- or pandemic phase-based information from epidemiological studies of reported cases and do not account for age-specific underdetection of reported cases. Here, we report likely pandemic spread using an age-structured model to understand the age- and setting-specific contribution of contacts to transmission during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. We developed a deterministic SEIRS model using a pre-pandemic contact matrix. The model was optimized to fit age-specific SARS-CoV-2 incidences reported by the German National Public Health Institute (Robert Koch Institute), includes information on setting-specific reported cases in schools and integrates age- and pandemic period-specific parameters for underdetection of reported cases deduced from a large population-based seroprevalence studies. Taking age-specific underreporting into account, younger adults and teenagers were identified in the modeling study as relevant contributors to infections during the first three pandemic waves in Germany. For the fifth wave, the Delta to Omicron transition, only age-specific parametrization reproduces the observed relative and absolute increase in pediatric hospitalizations in Germany. Taking into account age-specific underdetection did not change considerably how much contacts in schools contributed to the total burden of infection in the population (up to 12% with open schools under hygiene measures in the third wave). Accounting for the pandemic phase and age-specific underreporting is important to correctly identify those groups of the population in which quarantine, testing, vaccination, and contact-reduction measures are likely to be most effective and efficient.

Third doses of mRNA-based vaccines have provided a way to address waning immunity and broaden protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, their comparative effectiveness for a range of COVID-19 outcomes across diverse populations is unknown. We emulated a target trial using electronic health records of US veterans who received a third dose of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines between 20 October 2021 and 8 February 2022, during a period that included Delta- and Omicron-variant waves.

{"title": "Covid-19 variants: Impact on transmissibility and virulence.", "abstract": "The genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 began in February 2020, with G614 spike protein strains superseding D614 strains globally. Since then with each subsequent mutations, the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, namely Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron, superseded the previous one to become the dominant strain during the pandemic. By the end of November 2022, the Omicron variant and its descendent lineages account for 99.9% of sequences reported globally. All five VOCs have mutations located in the RBD of the spike protein, resulting in increased affinity of the spike protein to the ACE2 receptors resulting in enhanced viral attachment and its subsequent entry into the host cells. In vitro studies showed the mutations in spike protein help increase the viral fitness, enhancing both transmissibility and replication. In general, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants, were reported with higher transmissibility of 43-90%, around 50%, 170-240%, or 130-170% than their co-circulating VOCs, respectively. The Omicron however was found to be 2.38 times and 3.20 times more transmissible than Delta among the fully-vaccinated and boostervaccinated households. Even the SARS-Cov-2 Omicron subvariants appear to be inherently more transmissible than the ones before. With the broader distribution, enhanced evasion, and improved transmissibility, SARS-CoV-2 variants infection cause severe diseases due to immune escape from host immunity and faster replication. Reports have shown that each subsequent VOC, except Omicron, cause increased disease severity compared with those infected with other circulating variants. The Omicron variant infection however, appears to be largely associated with a lower risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and even a shorter length of hospital stay. It has been shown that the relatively much slower replication of the Omicron variants in the lung, resulted in a less severe disease.", "journal": "The Malaysian journal of pathology", "date": "2023-01-03", "authors": ["Y AMalik"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Exploring the binding capacity of lactic acid bacteria derived bacteriocins against RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant by molecular simulations.", "abstract": "The changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome have resulted in the emergence of new variants. Some of the variants have been classified as variants of concern (VOC). These strains have higher transmission rate and improved fitness. One of the prevalent were the Omicron variant. Unlike previous VOCs, the Omicron possesses fifteen mutations on the spike protein's receptor binding domain (RBD). The modifications of spike protein's key amino acid residues facilitate the virus' binding capability against ACE2, resulting in an increase in the infectiousness of Omicron variant. Consequently, investigating the prevention and treatment of the Omicron variant is crucial. In the present study, we aim to explore the binding capacity of twenty-two bacteriocins derived from Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) against the Omicron variant by using protein-peptidedocking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The Omicron variant RBD was prepared by introducing fifteen mutations using PyMol. The protein-peptide complexes were obtained using HADDOCK v2.4 docking webserver. Top scoring complexes obtained from HADDOCK webserver were retrieved and submitted to the PRODIGY server for the prediction of binding energies. RBD-bacteriocin complexes were subjected to MD simulations. We discovered promising peptide-based therapeutic candidates for the inhibition of Omicron variant for example Salivaricin B, Pediocin PA 1, Plantaricin W, Lactococcin mmfii and Enterocin A. The lead bacteriocins, except Enterocin A, are biosynthesized by food-grade lactic acid bacteria.

Although the third vaccination resulted in strong boosting of neutralization antibody, vaccine efficacy and correlate of immune protection against the major circulating Omicron BA.2 remain to be investigated.\nWe investigated the vaccine efficacy against the Omicron BA.2 breakthrough infection among 470 public servants who had received different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine regimens including two-dose BNT162b2 (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0BNT, n\u00a0=\u00a0169), three-dose BNT162b2 (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0BNT, n\u00a0=\u00a0168), two-dose CoronaVac (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CorV, n\u00a0=\u00a034), three-dose CoronaVac (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CorV, n\u00a0=\u00a067) and third-dose BNT162b2 following 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CorV (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CorV+1BNT, n\u00a0=\u00a032). Humoral and cellular immune responses after three-dose vaccination were further characterized and correlated with clinical characteristics of BA.2 infection.\nDuring the BA.2 outbreak, 27.7% vaccinees were infected. The timely third-dose vaccination provided significant protection with lower incidence rates of breakthrough infections (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0BNT 46.2% vs 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0BNT 13.1%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CorV 44.1% vs 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CorV 19.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Investigation of immune responses on blood samples derived from 90 subjects in three-dose vaccination cohorts collected before the BA.2 outbreak revealed that the third-dose vaccination activated spike (S)-specific memory B cells and Omicron cross-reactive T cell responses, which correlated with reduced frequencies of breakthrough infections and disease severity rather than with types of vaccines. Moreover, the frequency of S-specific activated memory B cells was significantly lower in infected vaccinees than uninfected vaccinees before vaccine-breakthrough infection whereas IFN-\u03b3\nOur results imply that the timely third vaccination and immune responses are likely required for vaccine-mediated protection against Omicron BA.2 pandemic. Although BA.2 conferred the highest neutralization resistance compared with variants of concern tested before the emergence of BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5, the third dose vaccination-activated S-specific memory B cells and Omicron cross-reactive T cell responses contributed to reduced frequencies of breakthrough infection and disease severity. Neutralizing antibody potency enhanced by BA.2 breakthrough infection in vaccinees with prior 3 doses of CoronaVac or BNT162b2 may reduce the risk of infection against ongoing BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5.\nHong Kong Research Grants Council Collaborative Research Fund, Health and Medical Research Fund, Wellcome Trust, Shenzhen Science and Technology Program, the Health@InnoHK, Innovation and Technology Commission of Hong Kong, China, National Program on Key Research Project, Emergency Key Program of Guangzhou Laboratory, donations from the Friends of Hope Education Fund and the Hong Kong Theme-Based Research Scheme.", "journal": "The Lancet regional health.

Although children are at low risk of severe COVID-19, the spreading of highly transmissible variants has led to increasing in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations also in the youngest, but vaccine coverage remains low. Immunogenicity to mRNA vaccines has not been extensively studied in children 5 to 11 years old. In particular, cellular immunity to the wild-type strain (Wuhan) and the cross-reactive response to the Omicron variant of concern has not been investigated. We assessed the humoral and cellular immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine in 27 healthy children.

The study aimed to determine the associations between boredom and aggressive behavior with aggression and to examine the impact of boredom on aggression through the moderating role of cognitive flexibility.\nThe Multidimensional State Boredom Scale, the Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire, and the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory were applied to a sample of 719 college students who were in a closed-off management environment.\nFor individuals with high cognitive flexibility, the relationship between state boredom and proactive aggression was not significant. The relationship between state boredom and proactive aggression was significantly positively correlated for individuals with low cognitive flexibility, especially low substitutability.

{"title": "SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children worldwide: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "abstract": "The higher hospitalisation rates of those aged 0-19 years (referred to herein as 'children') observed since the emergence of the immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and subvariants, along with the persisting vaccination disparities highlighted a need for in-depth knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 sero-epidemiology in children. Here, we conducted this systematic review to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and determinants in children worldwide.\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis study, we searched international and preprinted scientific databases from December 1, 2019 to July 10, 2022. Pooled seroprevalences were estimated according to World Health Organization (WHO) regions (at 95% confidence intervals, CIs) using random-effects meta-analyses. Associations with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and sources of heterogeneity were investigated using sub-group and meta-regression analyses. The protocol used in this study has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022350833).\nWe included 247 studies involving 757,075 children from 70 countries. Seroprevalence estimates varied from 7.3% (5.8-9.1%) in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to 37.6% (18.1-59.4%) in the fifth wave and 56.6% (52.8-60.5%) in the sixth wave. The highest seroprevalences in different pandemic waves were estimated for South-East Asia (17.9-81.8%) and African (17.2-66.1%) regions; while the lowest seroprevalence was estimated for the Western Pacific region (0.01-1.01%). Seroprevalence estimates were higher in children at older ages, in those living in underprivileged countries or regions, and in those of minority ethnic backgrounds.\nOur findings indicate that, by the end of 2021 and before the Omicron wave, around 50-70% of children globally were still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, clearly emphasising the need for more effective vaccines and better vaccination coverage among children and adolescents, particularly in developing countries and minority ethnic groups.\nNone.", "journal": "EClinicalMedicine", "date": "2023-01-03", "authors": ["RezaNaeimi", "MahdiSepidarkish", "AbolfazlMollalo", "HamidParsa", "SanazMahjour", "FatemehSafarpour", "MustafaAlmukhtar", "AmalMechaal", "HiamChemaitelly", "BehnamSartip", "ElikaMarhoommirzabak", "AliArdekani", "Peter JHotez", "Robin BGasser", "AliRostami"], "doi": "10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101786\n10.1101/2022.07.26.22278045\n10.1101/2022.07.06.22277306\n10.38192/1.6.1.13"}

Interestingly, tracing the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 shed light on a less frequent N501Y + Delta variant which has been in the global circulation for some time before the Omicron appearance. This paper aims to present the molecular characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike_N501Y + Delta variant detected in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The study was conducted during November and December 2021. All patients were tested using real-time RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2. A representative number of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples was pre-screened using VirSNiP SARS-CoV-2 Spike N501Y kit. The characterization of the viruses was carried out with Illumina RNA Prep with enrichment and the Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel kit. Among the analyzed sequences, we found two isolates of the Delta variant that differ from their most related clade- GK AY.4.3 in additional mutations N501Y and L54F. In this study, we described the presence of a rare form of Delta variant with Spike_N501Y mutation in the shadow of the Omicron emergence. Despite the set of mutations in the Spike protein, this form of Delta variant does not indicate the large-scale consequences for the general population.

{"title": "Changes in mobility amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Sapporo City, Japan: An investigation through the relationship between spatiotemporal population density and urban facilities.", "abstract": "By the end of 2021, the Omicron variant of coronavirus disease 2019 had become the dominant cause of a worldwide pandemic crisis. This demands a deeper analysis to support policy makers in creating interventions that not only protect people from the pandemic but also remedy its negative effects on the economy. Thus, this study investigated people's mobility changes through the relationship between spatiotemporal population density and urban facilities. Results showed that places related to daily services, restaurants, commercial areas, and offices experienced decreased visits, with the highest decline belonging to commercial facilities. Visits to health care and production facilities were stable on weekdays but increased on holidays. Educational institutions' visits decreased on weekdays but increased on holidays. People's visits to residential housing and open spaces increased, with the rise in residential housing visits being more substantial. The results also confirmed that policy interventions (e.g., declaration of emergency and upgrade of restriction level) have a great impact on people's mobility in the short term. The findings would seem to indicate that visit patterns at service and restaurant places decreased least during the pandemic. The analysis outcomes suggest that policy makers should pay more attention to risk perception enhancement as a long-term measure. Furthermore, the study clarified the population density of each facility type in a time series.

{"title": "Development, testing and validation of a SARS-CoV-2 multiplex panel for detection of the five major variants of concern on a portable PCR platform.", "abstract": "Many SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants have acquired mutations conferring phenotypes such as increased transmissibility or virulence, or causing diagnostic, therapeutic, or immune escape. Detection of Alpha and the majority of Omicron sublineages by PCR relied on the so-called S gene target failure due to the deletion of six nucleotides coding for amino acids 69-70 in the spike (S) protein. Detection of hallmark mutations in other variants present in samples relied on whole genome sequencing. However, whole genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is still in its infancy due to geographic inequities in sequencing capabilities, higher cost compared to other molecular assays, longer turnaround time from sample to result, and technical challenges associated with producing complete genome sequences from samples that have low viral load and/or high background. Hence, there is a need for rapid genotyping assays. In order to rapidly generate information on the presence of a variant in a given sample, we have created a panel of four triplex RT-qPCR assays targeting 12 mutations to detect and differentiate all five variants of concern: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron. We also developed an expanded pentaplex assay that can reliably distinguish among the major sublineages (BA.1-BA.5) of Omicron.

{"title": "Is diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection dogs reduced -due to virus variation- over the time?", "abstract": "Medical detection dogs have a high potential for use as alternative diagnostic tools not only for organic diseases, but also for infectious diseases. However, new variants emerging over time may affect the accuracy and sensitivity of diagnostic methods including medical detection dogs in case of viral pandemics. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer study aimed to investigate diagnostic performances and generalization ability of SARS-CoV-2 detection dogs against the new variant after being trained with the original virus. Two SARS-CoV-2 detection dogs were used in this study. In total, 1002 samples including the Omicron variant were introduced to the dogs using a double-blinded design. Two different refresher training sessions were conducted to train the dogs to identify the scent of the Omicron variant. In the first refreshment training, mixed samples (original virus and Omicron variant) were used.

{"title": "Antibiotic Prescription Audits Among Pediatric Outpatients With Acute Ailments in a Secondary Care Hospital During the COVID-19 Omicron Wave in Northern India.", "abstract": "Background Antibiotics, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), are pharmaceuticals used to treat bacterial infections. There is growing recognition that inappropriate antibiotic prescription in children is linked to increasing rates of severe adverse drug events and higher medical expenditures. There are a few prescriptions audit studies from smaller cities in Northern India, especially those conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic when\u00a0the unregulated private sector accounted for 90% of antibiotic sales and 75% of healthcare requirements. The\u00a0study objectives\u00a0were to determine the rate of outpatient antibiotic prescription and adherence to WHO drug indicators in prescriptions to pediatric outpatients in private healthcare facilities in India. Methodology This cross-sectional survey was conducted over three months (January to March 2022) in the outpatient setting of a private pediatric hospital in Kanpur, a city having a population of nearly three million population located in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. Prescriptions of children aged <10 years with a history of onset of complaint <14 days were included in this audit. Prescriptions were numbered;\u00a0data were collected using a specially designed semistructured, pretested prescription audit checklist; and the recommended WHO indicators were also calculated. Data were entered using CSPro (U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, USA) and analyzed using STATA 15 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Results This study observed an antibiotic prescription rate of 65.75%, which was higher than the WHO-recommended value, which might indicate indiscriminate usage of antibiotics in the setting. Out of the 144 antibiotic medications prescribed, none were generic and all the antibiotics were prescribed presumptively. The most commonly prescribed medicines were cefpodoxime, azithromycin, and ofloxacin, which were primarily used to treat cough and stomach infections. Conclusions This antibiotic audit conducted in a private hospital outpatient setting in a city in Northern India during the Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic found nongeneric, predominantly oral, presumptive antibiotic prescriptions in nearly two out of three young pediatric patients. Improvement in prescribing practices through regulation, monitoring, and antibiotic stewardship in low-resource settings is urgently warranted to curb the impending global pandemic of antimicrobial resistance.", "journal": "Cureus", "date": "2023-01-03", "authors": ["BaaniSodhi", "SauravBasu"], "doi": "10.7759/cureus.32017"}
{"title": "Nanophotonic reservoir computing for COVID-19 pandemic forecasting.", "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide in unprecedented speed, and diverse negative impacts have seriously endangered human society. Accurately forecasting the number of COVID-19 cases can help governments and public health organizations develop the right prevention strategies in advance to contain outbreaks. In this work, a long-term 6-month COVID-19 pandemic forecast in second half of 2021 and a short-term 30-day daily ahead COVID-19 forecast in December 2021 are successfully implemented via a novel nanophotonic reservoir computing based on silicon optomechanical oscillators with photonic crystal cavities, benefitting from its simpler learning algorithm, abundant nonlinear characteristics, and some unique advantages such as CMOS compatibility, fabrication cost, and monolithic integration. In essence, the nonlinear time series related to COVID-19 are mapped to the high-dimensional nonlinear space by the optical nonlinear properties of nanophotonic reservoir computing. The testing-dataset forecast results of new cases, new deaths, cumulative cases, and cumulative deaths for six countries demonstrate that the forecasted blue curves are awfully close to the real red curves with exceedingly small forecast errors. Moreover, the forecast results commendably reflect the variations of the actual case data, revealing the different epidemic transmission laws in developed and developing countries. More importantly, the daily ahead forecast results during December 2021 of four kinds of cases for six countries illustrate that the daily forecasted values are highly coincident with the real values, while the relevant forecast errors are tiny enough to verify the good forecasting competence of COVID-19 pandemic dominated by Omicron strain. Therefore, the implemented nanophotonic reservoir computing can provide some foreknowledge on prevention strategy and healthcare management for COVID-19 pandemic.", "journal": "Nonlinear dynamics", "date": "2023-01-03", "authors": ["BochengLiu", "YiyuanXie", "WeichenLiu", "XiaoJiang", "YichenYe", "TingtingSong", "JunxiongChai", "ManyingFeng", "HaodongYuan"], "doi": "10.1007/s11071-022-08190-z\n10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7\n10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3\n10.1016/j.chaos.2021.110861\n10.1038/s41392-021-00852-5\n10.1093/nsr/nwaa036\n10.1038/s41562-022-01289-8\n10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110511\n10.1016/j.rinp.2021.103817\n10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109864\n10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107161\n10.1016/j.psep.2020.11.007\n10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103791\n10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110212\n10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110336\n10.1007/s10489-020-01942-7\n10.1364/OE.26.005777\n10.1109/JSTQE.2020.3011879\n10.1109/JPHOT.2020.3048702\n10.1063/1.5129762\n10.1109/JQE.2022.3146561\n10.1109/JLT.2021.3124520\n10.1038/ncomms4541\n10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3115598\n10.1364/PRJ.409114\n10.1038/s41598-021-86150-0\n10.1109/LPT.2021.3075095\n10.1186/s40580-020-00222-x\n10.1038/s41377-021-00499-5\n10.1515/nanoph-2020-0592\n10.1364/OE.24.008679\n10.1364/OE.26.010211\n10.1063/1.4865204\n10.1103/RevModPhys.86.1391\n10.1038/ncomms15570\n10.1038/ncomms14965\n10.1016/j.psep.2020.10.048\n10.1056/NEJMc2115597\n10.1056/NEJMp2119682"}

Reactogenicity was assessed after 1 month, immunogenicity after 1, 3, and/or 6 months, including a third dose, through SARS-CoV-2 antispike immunoglobulin G, surrogate virus neutralization test, and a plaque reduction neutralization test against the Delta (B.1.167.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529; BA.1) variants of concern.\nThe overall reactogenicity was lower after heterologous vaccination. In both cohorts, SARS-CoV-2 antispike immunoglobulin G concentrations waned over time with the heterologous vaccination demonstrating higher neutralizing activity than homologous mRNA vaccination after 3 months to low neutralizing levels in the Delta plaque reduction neutralization test after 6 months. At this point, 3.2% of the heterologous and 11.4% of the homologous cohort yielded low neutralizing activity against Omicron. After a third dose of an mRNA vaccine, \u226599% of vaccinees demonstrated positive neutralizing activity against Delta. Depending on the vaccination scheme and against Omicron, 60% to 87.5% of vaccinees demonstrated positive neutralizing activity.\nChAdOx1-S/BNT162b2 vaccination demonstrated an acceptable reactogenicity and immunogenicity profile. A third dose of an mRNA vaccine is necessary to maintain neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2.

{"title": "An inactivated recombinant rabies virus chimerically expressed RBD induces humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and RABV.", "abstract": "Many studies suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect various animals and transmit among animals, and even to humans, posing a threat to humans and animals. There is an urgent need to develop inexpensive and efficient animal vaccines to prevent and control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in animals. Rabies virus (RABV) is another important zoonotic pathogen that infects almost all warm-blooded animals and poses a great public health threat. The present study constructed two recombinant chimeric viruses expressing the S1 and RBD proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan01 strain based on a reverse genetic system of the RABV SRV9 strain and evaluated their immunogenicity in mice, cats and dogs. The results showed that both inactivated recombinant viruses induced durable neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and RABV and a strong cellular immune response in mice. Notably, inactivated SRV-nCoV-RBD induced earlier antibody production than SRV-nCoV-S1, which was maintained at high levels for longer periods. Inactivated SRV-nCoV-RBD induced neutralizing antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 and RABV in cats and dogs, with a relatively broad-spectrum cross-neutralization capability against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, showing potential to be used as a safe bivalent vaccine candidate against COVID-19 and rabies in animals.", "journal": "Virologica Sinica", "date": "2023-01-02", "authors": ["HailiZhang", "HongliJin", "FeihuYan", "YumengSong", "JiaxinDai", "CuicuiJiao", "YujieBai", "JingxuanSun", "DiLiu", "ShenWang", "MengyaoZhang", "JilongLu", "JingboHuang", "PeiHuang", "YuanyuanLi", "XianzhuXia", "HualeiWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.virs.2022.12.006"}
{"title": "Impact of vaccination on the presence and severity of symptoms in hospitalized patients with an infection of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) of the SARS-CoV-2 (subvariant BA.1).", "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants raised questions about the extent to which vaccines designed in 2020 have remained effective. We aimed to assess whether vaccine status was associated with the severity of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients.\nWe conducted an international, multi-centric, retrospective study in 14 centres (Bulgaria, Croatia, France, and Turkey). We collected data on patients hospitalized for \u226524\u00a0hours between 1 December 2021 and 3 March 2022 with PCR-confirmed infection at a time of exclusive Omicron circulation and hospitalization related or not related to the infection. Patients who had received prophylaxis by monoclonal antibodies were excluded. Patients were considered fully vaccinated if they had received at least two injections of either mRNA and/or ChAdOx1-S or one injection of Ad26.CoV2-S vaccines.\nAmong 1215 patients (median age, 73.0\u00a0years; interquartile range, 57.0-84.0; 51.3% men), 746 (61.4%) were fully vaccinated. In multivariate analysis, being vaccinated was associated with lower 28-day mortality (Odds Ratio [95% Confidence Interval] (OR [95CI])\u00a0=\u00a00.50 [0.32-0.77]), intensive care unit admission (OR [95CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.40 [0.26-0.62]), and oxygen requirement (OR [95CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.34 [0.25-0.46]), independent of age and comorbidities. When co-analysing these patients with Omicron infection with 948 patients with Delta infection from a study we recently conducted, Omicron infection was associated with lower 28-day mortality (OR [95CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.53 [0.37-0.76]), intensive care unit admission (OR [95CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.19 [0.12-0.28]), and oxygen requirements (OR [95CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.50 [0.38-0.67]), independent of age, comorbidities, and vaccination status.\nOriginally designed vaccines have remained effective on the severity of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection.
