Health & Medicine. 2022; 4(6):322-326. Global Health & Medicine. 2022; 4(6):322-326.The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) \nremains a major public health emergency of international concern, resulting in a significant global disease burden. By September 1, 2022, there have been more than 600 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, and more than 6.4 million people globally have died following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ( 1). The \nOmicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly across the world, out-competing former variants soon after it was first detected in November 2021 ( 2).\n As the patients recovering from COVID-19 continue  \nto increase, long-term symptoms of COVID-19 (long COVID) after discharge from hospital have been widely reported ( 3-7). Long COVID is defined as the \npresence of signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID-19 and that continue for more than 12 weeks ( 8). These symptoms \ninclude fatigue, a cough, myalgia, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, headaches, and dyspnea and they affect the neurological, nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive systems ( 3,5,9,10 ). One early study found that of patients who had recovered from acute COVID-19, 87.4% reported persistence of at least one symptom, and fatigue and dyspnea in particular, at 1 month follow-up after discharge (9). As follow-up studies continue to report, there \nare significant differences in the prevalence of long-term symptoms among patients with COVID-19 after discharge ( 7,11-14 ) (Supplemental Table S1, https://\nwww.globalhealthmedicine.com/site/supplementaldata.html?ID=61 ). The main reason may be that new \nvariants appear to cause less severe acute illness than previous strains (2 ). However, the potential for large \nnumbers of patients experiencing long COVID is a major concern, and healthcare and workforce planners rapidly need information to appropriately allocate resources.\n At  the peak of the first wave of the outbreak in \nShenzhen in 2022, a large number of asymptomatic and mild cases involving Omicron emerged. As described here, a cohort study based on a telephone interview collected data on the sequelae of an Omicron infection at 3 months. Results were compared to a follow-up \n(322)DOI: 10.35772/ghm.2022.01069\nLong-term sequelae of different COVID-19 variants: The original \nstrain versus the Omicron variant\nXuejiao Liao1,\u00a7, Yuan Guan1,2,\u00a7, Qibin Liao1,\u00a7, Zhenghua Ma1, Liping Zhang1, Jingke Dong1, Xiaojuan Lai1,\nGuoqin Zheng1, Sumei Yang1,3, Cheng Wang1,3, Zhonghui Liao1,3, Shuo Song1, Hongyang Yi1, Hongzhou Lu1,*\n1 Institute for Hepatology, Bio-therapeutic Center, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital; The \nSecond Hospital Affiliated with the School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China;\n2 Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China;\n3 Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, Anhui, China.\nAbstract : Although Omicron appears to cause less severe acute illness than the original strain, the potential for large \nnumbers of patients to experience long COVID is a major concern.

In accordance with the Guidelines for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (9\nth edition) ( 15), potential subjects were over the age \nof 6, and they were excluded if they had a documented neurological or psychiatric disease. The categorization of COVID-19 disease severity was in accordance with the World Health Organization's interim guidance ( 16).\n Subjected were contacted by phone and asked \nabout their symptoms. A follow-up was conducted via \nphone on an outpatient basis, and subjects who have COVID-19 sequelae were recalled to the outpatient clinic for symptom-related laboratory testing until July 30, 2022. The recovery phase was defined as the period after discharge and more than 3 months after the diagnosis of COVID-19. Data on patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from an electronic medical record system. COVID-19 sequelae, which were defined as new and persistent symptoms and more severe symptoms than at the onset of COVID-19, were investigated by a well-trained nurse or doctor. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their guardians before participation in this study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Third People's Hospital (approval No.2022-074-02).\n Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of \nthe two groups of patients are summarized in Table 1. The patients infected with the original strain included 303 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Shenzhen Third People's Hospital between January 13 and May 22, 2020. Eighty-six (28.4%) had one or more long-term symptoms of COVID-19. The median age of patients infected with the original strain was 47 years of age (IQR: 35-59 years) and the median duration of hospitalization was 21 days. Disease severity was ordinary in 81.8% of patients, mild in 3.6%, and severe in 14.0%. Sixty-seven patients (21.8%) infected with the original strain had comorbidities, and the most common was hypertension. A total of 1,829 patients who were admitted during the period of Omicron were also available for a 3-month follow-up.

These results strongly suggested a \ncorrelation between the severity of the infection and the development of long-term complications. In the current study, 5.6% of patients infected with Omicron suffered from persistence of at least one symptom after a 3-month follow-up; this was a significant reduction from 28% in patients infected with the original strain. An analysis of the proportion of disease severity in the two groups also supported the contention that the severity of the infection affected long COVID.\n Among the clinical sequelae included in the current \nstudy, respiratory symptoms like a cough, tightness of the chest, and shortness of breath were most commonly reported in patients infected with the original strain, and dyspnea was also the second most frequent in patients infected with Omicron. The respiratory system is the primary target of SARS-CoV-2. Many patients who have recovered from COVID-19 still suffered from coughing and shortness of breath, and some patients with severe COVID-19 even developed extensive pulmonary fibrosis ( 17). Some subjects complained \nof dyspnea and an increased respiratory rate following light or moderate activity, even though the lung lesions had resolved completely according to high-resolution CT of the lungs, which indicated that COVID-19 can cause persistent damage. The pulmonary effects of SARS-CoV-1 were described in a 2-year follow-up, highlighting a marked diminishing of exercise capacity, respiratory function, and tolerance of exertion ( 18). In \npatients infected with the Omicron strain, fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom. To date, there is no pathophysiological explanation for fatigue in literature. One possible cause could be the prolonged hospitalization of patients, with consequent loss of muscle strength and tone mostly followed by an incomplete recovery (9). However, the patients infected with Omicron in the current study included those with a mild to moderate infection who were unlikely to have been bedridden for long periods of time, and the cause needs to be further explored.\n Neuropsychiatric sequelae caused by viral pathogens  \nhave always garnered attention when discussing long-term complications and persisting symptoms in patients who recovered from COVID-19. Approximately 2.7% of the patients infected with Omicron complained about experiencing neurological and psychological symptoms. Hypomnesia and anxiety are also commonly seen in other viral illnesses, and both psychical and psychological sequelae have been noted in MERS and SARS (7,9,19).\n There are several limitations to the current study . \nThis study was underpowered and thus unable to identify the factors that are directly correlation with the development of long-term sequelae in recovered one or more long-term symptoms of COVID-19. The median age of patients infected with the Omicron strain was 34 years of age (IQR: 26-47 years), and 957 (52.3%) were male. Disease severity was categorized as non-severe in all of those patients; disease severity was asymptomatic in 29.8%, mild in 61.6%, and ordinary in 8.6%.\n The characteristics  and prevalence of long-term \nclinical sequelae of COVID-19 are shown in Figure 1. The prevalence of long-term symptoms of COVID-19 was 28.4% in patients infected with the original strain and 5.63% in those infected with the Omicron strain. The most common respiratory symptom was a cough \n(18.5%), followed by tightness of the chest (6.5%) and \nshortness of breath (1.9%) in patients infected with the original strain. The prevalence of stomach pain was 1.6% and that of palpitations was 0.66%. Among the clinical sequelae in patients infected with the Omicron strain, fatigue was the most common general symptom (2.41%, 44/1,829). The prevalence of dyspnea was 1.69% (31/1,829) and that of tightness of the chest was 0.93% (17/1,829).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4129, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "397d145b-cbae-4fb1-ada2-e34c97c93369": {"__data__": {"id_": "397d145b-cbae-4fb1-ada2-e34c97c93369", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "10.35772_ghm.2022.01069.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\rsang\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hackathon2023\\Backend\\medical_research_article_summarize_service\\Omicron2023_01_012023_01_02.pdf\\10.35772_ghm.2022.01069.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 436040, "creation_date": "2023-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-20", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f69143be-8d9d-4df3-baf6-0e875efe05b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "10.35772_ghm.2022.01069.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\rsang\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hackathon2023\\Backend\\medical_research_article_summarize_service\\Omicron2023_01_012023_01_02.pdf\\10.35772_ghm.2022.01069.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 436040, "creation_date": "2023-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-20", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-20"}, "hash": "8bb40d60c57591f5d4f4808e1e7db7fa670388caa02260cb58a59aed63f377b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f20b9ea-5de8-48d9-a2f4-0ed3d038257d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "10.35772_ghm.2022.01069.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\rsang\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hackathon2023\\Backend\\medical_research_article_summarize_service\\Omicron2023_01_012023_01_02.pdf\\10.35772_ghm.2022.01069.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 436040, "creation_date": "2023-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-20", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-20"}, "hash": "e2fbd2c2b552d62c9732073bd984454b18484f9917ed622934f64d66c8a4facf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7fe8f328-ad47-47cc-805b-71b2f61b5ca4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "39f32c59b489fe32f2421289c72e80f607f13a86b562bb864207c70626b7c898", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6b485f0a8cccff0568354e4936892dca7de9813a86e8b9bae840bcfda1102fb0", "text": "The prevalence of long-term symptoms of COVID-19 was 28.4% in patients infected with the original strain and 5.63% in those infected with the Omicron strain.

That said, results did reveal the prevalence \nof long COVID and the most common persistent symptoms with different viral variants after 3 months. This study relied on a semi-structured phone interview, and symptoms were self-assessed instead of being measured by a validated scale. Accordingly, the results may have underestimated the health consequences of Omicron.\n As we continue to accrue experience, our \nunderstanding of the long-term complications of infection with SARS-CoV-2 continues to increase. Previously, long COVID, and especially fatigue, a cough, dyspnea, and psychological symptoms, was a frequent long-term complication of COVID-19. The common persistent symptoms of long COVID-19 in Omicron cases were similar to those in previous studies, but the overall incidence of long COVID was significantly lower. Supportive treatment is the basis for the treatment of respiratory symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Patients need to be allowed to rest in bed and to receive good nutrition since this could alleviate fatigue, tightness of the chest, and other serious symptoms. Considering the current high number of Omicron cases worldwide, healthcare professionals should not ignore its importance even though the incidence of sequelae is declining. Communities need to establish follow-up clinics for COVID-19 sequelae, including the provision of appropriate medical care and psychological counseling.\nAcknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank all of the subjects who \nparticipated in this study.\nFunding : This study is supported by the Shenzhen Science and \nTechnological Foundation (No. JSGG20220226090002003 \nand JSGG20220301090005007), the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen Foundation (No. G2021027), the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen Foundation (No. G2022062), and the Emergency Grants for Prevention and Control of SARS-CoV-2 of Guangdong Province (No. 2022A1111090001).\nConflict of Interest : The authors have no conflicts of \ninterest to disclose.\nReferences\n1.

Global Health & Medicine. 2022; 4(6):327-331.The world has been suffering from the COVID-19 \npandemic since the end of 2019, and Japan is \nno exception. Drastic changes have occurred in \nepidemiology, virology, public health, and the medical \nresponse to COVID-19 ( e.g., prevention, diagnosis, and \ntreatment). From a clinician's perspective, this work \noutlines the changes in and evolution of measures against \nCOVID-19 in Japan from the outbreak of the Delta \nvariant (the 5th wave) to the present outbreak due to the \nOmicron variant (the 7th wave) (from August 2021 to \nNovember 2022).\nA summary of changes in public health and political \nmeasures\nCountries have adopted different policies and \nphilosophies with respect to the pandemic. In the \nUnited Kingdom, for example, the government aimed \nto overcome the pandemic early, and all restrictions \nregarding COVID-19 were lifted in March 2022 ( 1). \nIn contrast, the Chinese Government has implemented \nstrict regulations known as the \"Zero-COVID policy\" \n(2). Unlike either of these approaches, Japan has \nimplemented multiple mitigation measures but it has not \nlifted most COVID-19 restrictions (Figure 1). \n Since the time of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, \nJapan has developed a vaccination program as one of its \nmain strategies against the pandemic. \n In May 2021, after former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga initiated the \"one million vaccinations per day\" \ncampaign during the 4th wave, the number of COVID-19 \ncases and deaths consequently fell ( 3). Japan faced the \n5th wave (late July - early October 2021) during the \nTokyo Olympic Games (23rd July - 8th August 2021) \ndue to the Delta variant. The Delta variant was notorious \nfor its high virulence; even young patients occasionally \nsuccumbed to severe disease ( 4). Hospitals kept being \noverwhelmed with many COVID-19 patients, especially \npatients who were unvaccinated ( 5). The Japanese \nGovernment declared a 4th state of emergency (12th \nJul 2021-30th Sep 2021) and semi-emergency measures \n(known as \"Man-bo\" in Japanese) to reduce the number \nof cases and severe cases. \n Japan is currently facing waves of the Omicron \nvariant, with the 6th in mid-January- early June 2022 and \nthe 7th in early July - early October 2022. The Omicron \nvariant has a higher transmissibility than any previous \nVariants of Concern (VOCs) ( 6).\n In early 2022, under the current Prime Minister \nFumio Kishida, the government devised a new concept, \n\"Living with COVID-19\", to live with SARS-CoV-2 \ninstead of suppressing it. The decline in mortality \namong patients with COVID-19 compared to that \nduring the early stages of the pandemic corroborated \nthis approach ( 7).\n The government shortened the quarantine period for \npeople who had close contact with COVID-19 patients \n(July 2022), it subsequently shortened the quarantine \n(327)DOI: 10.35772/ghm.2022.01071\nTowards the light at the end of the tunnel: Changes in clinical settings \nand political measures regarding COVID-19 from 2021, and future \nperspectives in Japan\nKohei Kamegai *, Kayoko Hayakawa\nDisease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.\nAbstract : Japan has faced seven waves of the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020.

In August 2022, \nJapan's weekly number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 \npatients was the highest worldwide for four weeks. \nThis is probably a misleading figure because Japan still \nconducted notifiable disease surveillance to actively \ndiagnose and report cases, whereas other countries \nreduced the rounds of testing. \n In September 2022, the government changed the \"all \nreporting policy\" of notifiable disease surveillance of \nCOVID-19 and Japan opened its borders to the outside, \nshifting toward a world where we are \"Living with \nCOVID-19\".\nClinical issues\nChanges in clinical epidemiology\nDuring the 5th wave, the proportion of severe cases \nwas high mainly because the virulent Delta variant \nwas dominant. Most patients who needed immediate \nhospitalization were unvaccinated or had an underlying \nillness. Overloaded hospitals had difficulty promptly \nreceiving patients with severe COVID-19 or who were at \nhigh risk of becoming severely ill. \n During the 6th and 7th waves, when Omicron was \nthe main variant, the disease was less severe than that \ndue to the Delta variant. The Omicron variant is less \nvirulent than conventional strains and may be less deadly \nthan seasonal influenza ( 8). Patients in critical condition \nwho needed specialized urgent care, such as intubation \nand extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, were seldom \nseen ( 5). However, the number of COVID-19 patients increased \nmore than before, mainly because of the enhanced \ntransmissibility of the Omicron variant. A review \nindicated that the Omicron variant has a mean primary \nreproduction number of 8.2, 3.8 times higher than that \nof the Delta variant ( 6). Most admitted patients are \nsenior citizens, and young patients with mild disease are \nadvised to stay home, even if unvaccinated.\n Outside large hospitals, calls for on-site clinics, \nremote medical interviews, and at-home medical care \nincreased. \n The causes of death have also been changed as a \nconsequence. According to a brief report from a national \nhospital in Tokyo, the leading cause of death during the \ndays of Omicron was exacerbation of pre-hospitalization \ncomplications (46%; 11 out of 24 deaths), followed by \nrespiratory failure due to pneumonia (29%; 7/24 deaths.), \nwhich was far lower than that during the days of Delta \n(80%; 16 out of 20 deaths) ( 9)\n The aforementioned report implies that succumbing \nto COVID-19 is less likely but that the virus still causes \ndeath among the most vulnerable. Thus, COVID-19 is \nstill a serious threat that cannot be ignored. \nTreatment\nEmerging evidence has revealed that the pillars for the \ntreatment of COVID-19 include early antiviral therapy, \nsteroids such as dexamethasone for patients needing \noxygen, and appropriate anticoagulation ( 10).\n For patients in dire need of oxygen, adjunctive \nimmunomodulators such as tocilizumab and baricitinib \nare also available.

Some may believe misinformation without \nevidence, increasing their mistrust of evidence-based \nmedicine. Mass media such as TV channels, social \nmedia, and movie streaming sites are responsible for \nspreading information. Former President of the United \nStates Donald Trump publicly supported the antimalarial \ndrug hydroxychloroquine, and former President of \nBrazil Jair Bolsonaro advocated chloroquine, both of \nwhich have not proven effective against COVID-19. The \ngovernment, local authorities, and scientific experts must \ncollaborate to establish an effective and clear message \nand to proactively combat fake news.\n Within the bounds of free speech, every  \ncommunication must be evidence-based and unbiased. \nEvery disseminator of information should be aware of its \nresponsibility and its possible impact on society. Severe \nadverse reactions to vaccines should be acknowledged \nas a fact, but messages should nonetheless support \nmass vaccination programs because they are absolutely \nessential to alleviating a pandemic's effects on society. \nVarious challenges to Japan's healthcare system remain\nFirst, some facilities and clinics still do not accept \nCOVID-19 patients or people with suspected symptoms \nof COVID-19. Patients in a particular condition (such \nas pregnant women, newborns, and people who need \nspecialized care) often have difficulty promptly accessing \nmedical care. This is presumably because of a lack of \nknowledge and experience. Since we face a pandemic, \nthe entire healthcare system must tackle this public \nenemy. \n Most patients infected with Omicron have mild \ndisease, so stratification of healthcare facilities may be \neffective; clinics and doctors providing at-home care \ncould take on risk-free patients with mild symptoms \nwhile referring patients in serious condition to larger \nhospitals. Testing should be prioritized for vulnerable \npeople to optimize the workforce. The over-the-counter \nself-antigen test should be encouraged for people without \nrisk of severe disease to reduce unnecessary doctor visits. \n Second, the role of surveillance is likely to be \naffected because notifiable disease surveillance changed \ndramatically after September 26, 2022. Nowadays, \nonly patients with the following conditions are to be \nreported: those who are i) older than 65 years of age, \nii) hospitalized, iii) with severe disease risk factors and \nreceiving COVID-specific treatment, or iv) pregnant. \nAs a result, follow-up with patients who do not fall into \nthese categories through surveillance will be difficult. \nIn medicine, a close eye has to be kept on the unusual casirivimab/imdevimab and sotrovimab were approved \nin July 2021 and September 2021, respectively. However, \nthere is a concern that the efficacy of these drugs may \ndecrease with the Omicron subvariants (B1.1.529/\nBA.2, BA.4, and BA.5.strains) ( 11,12 ), so these drugs \nare currently withheld in clinical practice. Available \nantivirals in Japan are similar to those in the US, such \nas remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, \nwith indicated use for patients with risk factors for severe \ndisease. All of these antivirals and monoclonal antibodies \nwere controlled by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and \nWelfare when they were first approved, and remdesivir \nand molnupiravir are now in general distribution. \nEnsitrelvir is the first-ever Japanese-made oral antiviral \ngranted approval for emergency use in November 2022. \nThe current recommendation is to consider using it for \npatients with clinical symptoms such as a high fever, bad \ncough, and severe sore throat ( 13). Further considerations \nregarding the population to receive this drug should be \nbased on the results of future clinical trials.\nVaccine and pre-exposure prophylaxis\nEncouraging vaccines is the most reliable way to \nprevent severe disease and infection.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4132, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56dd6488-078a-4c49-ab35-2cbf1929320c": {"__data__": {"id_": "56dd6488-078a-4c49-ab35-2cbf1929320c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "10.35772_ghm.2022.01071.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\rsang\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hackathon2023\\Backend\\medical_research_article_summarize_service\\Omicron2023_01_012023_01_02.pdf\\10.35772_ghm.2022.01071.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 478114, "creation_date": "2023-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-20", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af9e4d7d-db36-42dd-8d0c-82ae1d165162", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "10.35772_ghm.2022.01071.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\rsang\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hackathon2023\\Backend\\medical_research_article_summarize_service\\Omicron2023_01_012023_01_02.pdf\\10.35772_ghm.2022.01071.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 478114, "creation_date": "2023-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-20", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-20"}, "hash": "22b5bb6a2b90a9c7c758dcaf7a3603090d5110528d149cf445efafc95b5d6281", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a052d1d-7145-4f8e-9931-3b40d8b88bf0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "10.35772_ghm.2022.01071.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\rsang\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Hackathon2023\\Backend\\medical_research_article_summarize_service\\Omicron2023_01_012023_01_02.pdf\\10.35772_ghm.2022.01071.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 478114, "creation_date": "2023-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-20", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-20"}, "hash": "5c220a655e101ecb00838b7e22b018759873bb9d37c9b241457050818af1a7f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "07b479be-7792-4fbd-a6de-f02b80635af8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "83e590578e6e9108c3364867cd4b0c644b29612665dc521e685ebf5261312cd1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d68ccdafde3d46f682d6407bd753411c9a83ff01b69e58df2a991994deb88e49", "text": "All of these antivirals and monoclonal antibodies \nwere controlled by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and \nWelfare when they were first approved, and remdesivir \nand molnupiravir are now in general distribution. \nEnsitrelvir is the first-ever Japanese-made oral antiviral \ngranted approval for emergency use in November 2022. \nThe current recommendation is to consider using it for \npatients with clinical symptoms such as a high fever, bad \ncough, and severe sore throat ( 13).

Global Health & Medicine. 2022; 4(6):327-331.(330)clinical course of unreported cases. Periodic studies of \nparticular populations, such as children, might need to \nbe conducted. In addition, precautions are required for \nracial and ethnic minorities who are at a greater risk \nof COVID-19 exposure ( 16). The low severity of the \ndisease and its impact on daily life may cause people to \nforego testing. As a result, the number of people with \nundiagnosed \"hidden COVID-19\" may increase as the \ninfection spreads. \"Hidden COVID-19\" may trigger an \noutbreak of varying size in various settings. Therefore, \na preemptive policy on preventing infection might be \nnecessary for certain circumstances, and especially where \na vulnerable population is involved. \n As the government opens the borders, new variants \nwill enter into Japan. In November 2022, there were \nsigns of other outbreaks of BQ.1, BQ1.1, and XBB \n(recombinants of the BJ.1 and BM1.1.1 lineages) \nthat may negatively affect vaccine effectiveness ( 17). \nGenetic mutations appear one after another, so quality \nsurveillance should be maintained by enhancing genomic \nsurveillance.\n Third, in some medical settings such as nursing homes \nor remote areas, essential public health supplies to protect \nhealthcare workers tend to run short. The World Health \nOrganization guidelines recommend using droplet and \ncontact precautions (medical masks, gowns, gloves, and \neye protection) for all healthcare workers when caring \nfor patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 ( 18). \nThe pandemic has revealed longstanding vulnerabilities \nin the supply chain for essential items. Remedies such \nas enhancing domestic manufacturing and use of digital \ntechnology should soon be implemented. \n Fourth, effective antivirals that reduce the proportion \nof severe cases have been distributed disproportionately. \nIn medically underserved areas such as mountain regions \nand remote islands, oral antivirals may play a more \ncrucial role than in urban areas, since there may be \nminimal or no hospital beds. The government and local \nauthorities have to tackle this problem soon to prevent \ngreater disparities in accessing treatment. \nVaccination\nVaccine hesitancy is a significant challenge to ending \nthis pandemic. Multifaceted problems contribute \nto it, including socioeconomic status, low trust in \ngovernment, fake news, rumors spread by influential \npeople, and incorrect advice from primary care doctors. \nVaccination should be increasingly encouraged since \nit offers the most robust protection one can have, and \nespecially when preceded by previous infections (i.e., \nhybrid immunity) ( 19). \nConclusion\nWe have discussed 3 prongs of a possible approach to \nend this pandemic. A society-wide strategy involving multiple stakeholders should be adopted to mitigate the \ndamage and achieve a world where we are \"Living with \nCOVID-19\".\nFunding : None.\nConflict of Interest : The authors have no conflicts of \ninterest to disclose.\nReferences\n1.

There is growing recognition that inappropriate antibiotic prescription in children is linked to\nincreasing rates of severe adverse drug events and higher medical expenditures. There are a few\nprescriptions audit studies from smaller cities in Northern India, especially those conducted during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic when the unregulated private sector accounted for 90% of antibiotic sales and 75% of\nhealthcare requirements. The study objectives were to determine the rate of outpatient antibiotic\nprescription and adherence to WHO drug indicators in prescriptions to pediatric outpatients in private\nhealthcare facilities in India.\nMethodology\nThis cross-sectional survey was conducted over three months (January to March 2022) in the outpatient\nsetting of a private pediatric hospital in Kanpur, a city having a population of nearly three million population\nlocated in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. Prescriptions of children aged <10 years with a history of onset\nof complaint <14 days were included in this audit. Prescriptions were numbered; data were collected using a\nspecially designed semistructured, pretested prescription audit checklist; and the recommended WHO\nindicators were also calculated. Data were entered using CSPro (U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, USA)\nand analyzed using STATA 15 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).\nResults\nThis study observed an antibiotic prescription rate of 65.75%, which was higher than the WHO-\nrecommended value, which might indicate indiscriminate usage of antibiotics in the setting. Out of the 144\nantibiotic medications prescribed, none were generic and all the antibiotics were prescribed presumptively.\nThe most commonly prescribed medicines were cefpodoxime, azithromycin, and ofloxacin, which were\nprimarily used to treat cough and stomach infections.\nConclusions\nThis antibiotic audit conducted in a private hospital outpatient setting in a city in Northern India during the\nOmicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic found nongeneric, predominantly oral, presumptive antibiotic\nprescriptions in nearly two out of three young pediatric patients. Improvement in prescribing practices\nthrough regulation, monitoring, and antibiotic stewardship in low-resource settings is urgently warranted to\ncurb the impending global pandemic of antimicrobial resistance.\nCategories:\n Pediatrics, Public Health, Health Policy\nKeywords:\n health public, covid-19, prescription audit, antibiotics therapy, antibiotic resistance (abr)\nIntroduction\nAntibiotics, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), are pharmaceuticals used to treat bacterial\ninfections \n[1]\n.

The per-capita antibiotic consumption in the Indian retail sector was observed to increase from\n13.1 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day (DID) in 2008 to 16.0 DID in 2012 (a 22% increase),\nalong with increased consumption of new classes of antibiotics \n[7]\n.\nIrrational prescription of antibiotics is strongly linked with triggering accelerated antibiotic resistance, a\nphenomenon through which microorganisms induce changes in themselves that render them protection\nagainst prior antibiotic susceptibility \n[1,8-10]\n. Furthermore, there is growing recognition that inappropriate\nantibiotic prescription in children is linked to increasing rates of severe adverse drug events and higher\nmedical expenditures \n[11]\n. Moreover, prescribing errors contribute to a further increase in patient morbidity\nand mortality \n[12-14]\n. Misuse of medications, especially antibiotics, is frequently an outcome of ineffective\nregulation and lack of sensitization and education of stakeholders, including prescribers, consumers, and\ndispensers, suggestive of the need for diverse intervention measures \n[15,16]\n.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, globally, there has been a substantial increase in antibiotic prescriptions\nfor both prophylaxis and active management of COVID-19 despite the proven lack of efficacy of antibiotic\nformulations against a viral disease \n[17]\n. In India, the unregulated private sector accounted for 90% of\nantibiotics sales and 75% of healthcare services in this period \n[18,19]\n.\nThe WHO recommends the assessment of drug use practices as part of an audit process in healthcare\nsystems through the measurement of standardized indicators to curb drug misuse and improve the quality of\nhealthcare \n[20]\n. The prescription audit is a systematic critical analysis to assess the quality of medical care.\nThe rational use of drugs is based on the rule of right: right drug, right patient, right dose, and right cost\n[21]\n.\nThere are a few prescriptions audit studies from smaller cities in Northern India, from private care facilities,\nespecially those conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this study were to determine\nthe rate of outpatient antibiotic prescription and adherence to WHO drug indicators in prescriptions to\npediatric outpatients in private healthcare facilities in India.\nMaterials And Methods\nDesign and setting\nThis prescription audit was part of a larger cross-sectional survey conducted in the outpatient setting of a\nprivate pediatric hospital in Kanpur, a city having a population of nearly three million located in the state of\nUttar Pradesh in India. The facility was catering to patients across all economic strata, and most respondents\nhad no insurance coverage. The average total patient count per day was 20. The study was conducted during\nthe Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India from January to March 2022.\nStudy participants\nPrescriptions of children aged <10 years with a history of onset of complaint <14 days were included in this\naudit. Exit interviews were also conducted with the parents or caregivers of the children. Children reporting\ncomplaints relating to a chronic illness or those referred from any other healthcare facility were excluded.\nNone of the patients reported a diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection although some had submitted\nsamples to the diagnostic laboratories and were awaiting their test results.\nA total of 219 face-to-face interviews were conducted, with a response rate of 100%, with nearly seven\nprescriptions assessed per day by consecutive sampling. The high response rate was due to\nthe recommendation by the treating physician.

Written and informed consent was obtained from all the study\nparticipants.\nResults\nA total of 219 pediatric outpatient prescriptions were assessed in this study. The age of the pediatric patients\nin the study was mean = 3.46 (SD 2.79) years (ranging from 1 month to 9.5 years), and of the 219\npatients, 139 (63.47%) were males and 80 (36.53%) were females. Clinical history was mentioned only in 66\n(30.14%) of the prescriptions and blood or urine culture was not recommended in any of the cases.\nAntibiotics were prescribed in 144 (65.75%) cases, with 64 (44.4%) prescribed for the common cold.

The prescribing practices are crucial as only\nrational prescriptions can ensure therapeutic efficacy and safety \n[24]\n.\nIn this study, nearly two in three prescriptions included antibiotics. Secondary data analysis of a nationally\nrepresentative pharmaceutical sales database from India found the rate of antibiotic prescription in children\naged 0 to 4 years was 636 prescriptions per 1,000 persons, which is similar to our study \n[7]\n. In this study, the\nhigh rate of antibiotic prescription may also be due to the then ongoing Omicron wave of the COVID-19\npandemic in India and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) owing to raised levels of social\nanxiety and lack of adherence to evidence-based medicine by prescribers apart from increased over-the-\ncounter sales \n[17,19,25]\n.\nIllegible prescriptions are a major cause of medication errors and avoidable cause of harm to patients \n[6,12]\n.\nPrevious Indian studies show a pattern of significant variation in the proportion of illegible prescriptions. A\nprescription audit study from the state of Kerala reported only 3.4% (122/3,557) prescriptions as\nillegible \n[17]\n.

In agreement with this, our\nstudy also found high rates of presumptive antibiotic prescribing patterns for similar symptomatic profiles.\nNo injectable medications were prescribed in our study setting, which is much lower than previous\nstudies \n[24,27]\n as our study focused on only children aged <10 years within outpatient settings, whereas\nother studies focused on adults.\nNo generic antibiotic medication prescriptions were observed in this audit. The WHO recommended\nindividual countries develop their own locally appropriate national medicines policy that primarily focused\non improved access to the high-quality and rational use of generic medicines \n[28]\n. Even though there has\nbeen a recent thrust toward promoting high-quality and low-cost generic medications in India through\nmajor government initiatives \n[29]\n, patient and provider perceived concerns about their safety and efficacy\ncompared with branded drugs diminish their acceptability \n[20,30]\n.\nThis study's strengths include data collection from a private healthcare setting of a smaller city in Northern\nIndia and study sites that are usually neglected by previous such research in India, which were conducted in\ngovernment health facilities or larger private hospitals with multiple providers. However, these smaller\nhealthcare facilities in urban and suburban areas of the country provide cumulative health access to millions\nof people and are potential drivers of antibiotic resistance through presumptive antibiotic overuse by\npractitioners.\nAdditional strengths of this study are a response rate of 100%, which ensured there was no missing data. The\nuse of validated forms ensured that the data collected are standardized and comparable with previous\nstudies. As the study site hospital catered to patients from all economic backgrounds, the study population\nwas more representative of the local community.\nStudy limitations are the lack of external validity as the study was conducted in only a single private\noutpatient setting in Kanpur city and focused only on pediatric (aged <10 years) prescriptions and had a\nrelatively smaller sample size for assessing prescribing indicators.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, this antibiotic audit conducted in a private hospital outpatient setting in a city in Northern\nIndia during the Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic found nongeneric, predominantly oral,\npresumptive antibiotic prescriptions in nearly two out of three young pediatric patients. Improvement in\nprescribing practices through regulation, monitoring, and antibiotic stewardship in low-resource settings is\nurgently warranted to curb the impending global pandemic of antimicrobial resistance. \nAdditional Information\nDisclosures\nHuman subjects:\n Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
